## Manifesto

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to spread self-hosting by serving the artistic community. We believe that creatives should have full control over their digital work. We aim to foster a culture of trust, equity, and long-term growth. We provide the knowledge and tools you need to keep _your_ work in _your_ cloud today.

> Self-hosting is the practice of keeping your own computing resources as an alternative to commercial services, allowing you to manage, store, and control your digital assets independently. Self-hosting protects:
> 1. **Your data**: Your files stay in your private space, not someone elseâ€™s data center. You physically own your virtual life.
> 1. **Your freedom**: You can freely access, move, and share data. inthecloud.today uses open-source technologies that are free from vendor lock-in.
> 1. **Your wallet**: Hosting your cloud is generally cheaper than subscribing to profit-driven cloud providers.

## Why Artists? Why Self-Hosting?

We believe that artists represent a community uniquely positioned to adopt self-hosting due to their concerns for privacy, digital ownership, and cost-efficiency.

### Concerns for Privacy and Ownership
As generative AI and large-scale models grow, the community has become increasingly concerned about where and how work is stored and accessed. Self-hosting allows you to protect your privacy and ensure your creations are not commoditized or used without your consent.

### Financial Constraints
Many artists work within tight budgets, and self-hosting offers an affordable, long-term solution that saves money, allowing you to invest in your art instead of recurring fees.

### Specialized Needs and Flexibility
Artists often need large storage for media or specialized equipment for specific tasks. With self-hosting, you can customize your system to meet these needs and fit the way you work. Your openness to new methods and experimentation makes you well-suited for self-hosting.

### Thrive on Collaboration  
Artists often collaborate and support each other in communities. Self-hosting strengthens this collaboration by enabling you to take ownership of your digital space and work more freely with peers.

## Our Vision

We aim to lower the barriers to self-hosting by providing you with easy-to-use tools, educational resources, and community support. Our goal is to make self-hosting accessible, even for those with limited technical knowledge, while fostering a network of artists who can share knowledge, resources, and time. We promote creative freedom by empowering you to take control of your digital life, ensuring your work is protected, preserved, and presented on your own terms.
